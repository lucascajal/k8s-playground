# Kubernetes playground and examples
This repository serves as my personal kubernetes learning journal. It contains examples and tests for testing & playing with kuberentes, using kind. It evolves as new concepts are learned and tested.

The final picture should end up looking similar to the [ðŸš€ ArgoCD Self-Managed Example](https://github.com/imjoseangel/k8s-gitops) repository, which is a core reference for this learning journey, and [it's maintainer](https://github.com/imjoseangel) a mentor. Big kudos to him.
